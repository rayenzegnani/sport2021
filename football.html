    <p >Former Manchester United defender Phil Neville has hit out at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's decision not to include Paul Pogba in the Red Devils' starting lineup.</p>
       <p> United are stacked for options in midfield and Pogba has only been used as a substitute in United's last two matches, with Fred and Scott McTominay being preferred by Solskjaer against Everton.</p>
        
        <p>The Red Devils recovered from their Champions League defeat to Istanbul Basaksehir as they ran out 3-1 winners on Merseyside, but Neville believes that it is "absolutely disgraceful" that Pogba was not included from the first whistle.</p>
        
       <p> Speaking to Premier League Productions, Neville said: "I still think it's absolutely disgraceful that Pogba can't get in that team.</p>
        
       <p> "For United to win a league, for United to be successful, for United to play the style of football that Ole wants them to play then Pogba has to play.</p>
        
       <p> "You can play one of them [Nemanja] Matic, Fred or [Scott] McTominay and then you play Pogba with [Bruno] Fernandes. I know I've said about him wanting to leave, not wanting to be there and his inconsistencies but I still think he's one of the best midfielders around.</p>
        
       <p>"That's why I'm thinking 'Why is Paul Pogba not in that team?'"</p>
        
       <p> Speculation surrounding Pogba's long-term future has started to intensify amid his lack of starts, with a recent report claiming that Real Madrid are eyeing a swoop for the World Cup-winning Frenchman next year.</p>
